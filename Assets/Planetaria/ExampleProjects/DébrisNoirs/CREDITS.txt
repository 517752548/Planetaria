@EmilyClaire - virtually all best practices (e.g. testing, code etiquette, documentation, etc), several game design choices (e.g. truth to the original, lighting), fixed my GPU for a better trailer video, and many algorithm/architecture choices in Debris Noirs (e.g. debris spawning, user interface, projectiles) and Planetaria (e.g. PlanetariaAudioSource).
@mattrdowney - implementation (code, graphics, sound)
Inspired by Asteroids (1979) - Atari, Ed Logg, Lyle Rains, Dominic Walsh
